1.Run the commands sort, wc and uniq on the commands.js file. Explain how they work and what the output was.

Sort-works by sorting a list of items alphabetically and numerically.
wc	-checks the file for every line, word and character used and it output 39 101 1050
uniq- removes identical adjacent lines but since no lines are identical just preforms `cat`

2.Using the pipe (|) connect at least two commands and run it on commands.js. Explain what the output was and why the specific data was outputted.

A:  I used (tail commands.js | head) and the output was the last 6 lines of commands.js. This is due to using tail first to get the last 7 lines of commands.js then from that 7 getting the first 6 lines. 

6.

function reverseString(inputString) {
	var words = inputString.split(' ');
	var reversed = [];
	words.forEach((word) =>{
		reversed.push(word.split('').reverse().join(''));
	});
  return reversed.join(' ');
}
